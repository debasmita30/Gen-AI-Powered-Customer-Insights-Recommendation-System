üìå Overview

This project demonstrates an AI-powered dynamic pricing engine built using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in reinforcement learning. The system simulates real-world market conditions to optimize pricing strategies, aiming to maximize profits while considering factors like demand, competitor pricing, and inventory levels.

üöÄ Key Features

Interactive Streamlit Dashboard: A user-friendly interface with sliders to adjust market conditions and visualize the impact on pricing strategies.

Real-Time Price Optimization: Utilizes PPO to predict optimal pricing based on current market dynamics.

Dynamic Profit Visualization: Displays profit trends against various price points, highlighting the predicted optimal price.

Market Condition Randomization: A feature to simulate different market scenarios, enhancing the robustness of the pricing strategy.

Performance Metrics: Tracks and visualizes training rewards over episodes to monitor the learning progress of the model.

üß† Technical Details

Reinforcement Learning Model: Implemented PPO using TensorFlow/Keras, comprising:

Actor Network: Predicts the optimal pricing action.

Critic Network: Evaluates the value of the current state to guide the actor.

Custom Environment: Developed using Gymnasium to simulate a dynamic pricing scenario with continuous state and action spaces.

Training Loop: The agent learns over 200 episodes, optimizing pricing strategies to maximize profit.
